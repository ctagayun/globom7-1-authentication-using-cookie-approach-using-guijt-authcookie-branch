Module 7: Authentication and Deployment

  - Deployment React Project
      - https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/fbbac3b2-0e56-464b-92f2-0b877f92f12c/c2709893-6776-4589-bc6c-699eeb71d6a5/f2de7518-23c4-4576-8877-2169ea14ab86
    
      - first do a production build in React:
            npm run buld --> creates "dist" folder
    
      - dist/index-Z8cH2rkp - contains all javscript files of entire application

    

  - Deployment API

     - do dotnet publish --> will create a Api/bin/Release. Contains many files,
       take note of Api.dll, Api.exe, Api.pdb

    - the ap can be started from .bin\release\net8.0
        -  cd .\bin\Release\net8.0\
        - dotnet api.dll
        - dotnet api.exe can also be used to start the app

     1. Introduction Cookie Approach

          - we always need a server-side app that can keep secrets. Heres the concept 
            of Cookie approach: 
              1. API serves the static assets of the React production 
              build and it has session endpoints such as login and logout. The api 
              is now a backend instead of API is more in order.

              2. it uses SameSite cookies. No cross-site use allowed. Except GET requests.

     2. Hosting React App inside Asp.netcore API project (Cookie approach)
          - clone this AuthCookie branch of repo https://github.com/rolandguijt/ps-globomantics-webapi-react
          
          - Lets see how it is done: https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/fbbac3b2-0e56-464b-92f2-0b877f92f12c/c2709893-6776-4589-bc6c-699eeb71d6a5/e405b0bb-51f8-4add-8058-8cf14e48326b

          - To see how it is done switch to branch AuthCookie
              - put the output of api production build tp wwwroot folder
